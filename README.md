# make facebook great again

I've had a number of friends mention that they wish they could filter all the Hillary/Trump out of there news feed. So I wrote a simple plugin allowing Facebook to be filtered by keyword. Currently The plugin has the default keywords of "hillary" and "trump" but is fully user controllable. 


Currently the plugin can filter by a single word or any string such as "Bart Simpson"
